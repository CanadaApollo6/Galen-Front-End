This is the repository for the Gravity Diagnostics front-end PCR UI replacement application. It supports the integration of TensorFlowJS neural networks, importing of PCR Quant Excel files, and exporting in a format required for Gravity's other internal systems for patient notification.

It was built over a period of 6 months with direct feedback from lab techs and and lab directors about how they wanted things to look and what kinds of features they wanted to see.

Included are screenshots of the app working.
